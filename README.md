# Android_Room_Example
In this application a small example of a CRUD is done using the Room persistence library.

Introduction
------------

In May 2017 Google released the Architecture Components libraries.
Each library manages and simplifies aspects of data persistence and the
UI component lifecycle. Together, the libraries encourage a modular
app architecture that results in reduced complexity and less code.

This sample shows how to use the libraries to build
a complete basic app that implements the recommended architecture
and can be used as a template for further explorations.


Pre-requisites
--------------

* Android Studio 3.0 or later and you know how to use it.

* Make sure Android Studio is updated, as well as your SDK and Gradle.
Otherwise, you may have to wait for a while until all the updates are done.

* A device or emulator that runs API level 26

You need to be solidly familiar with the Java programming language,
object-oriented design concepts, and Android Development Fundamentals.
In particular:

* RecyclerView and Adapters
* SQLite database and the SQLite query language
* Threading and AsyncTask
* It helps to be familiar with software architectural patterns that separate
  data from the user interface, such as MVP or MVC. This codelab implements the
  architecture defined in the
  [Guide to App Architecture](
  https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/guide.html)
